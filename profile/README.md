# Reportmate

**Reportmate** is a modular, cross-platform endpoint reporting system powered by **osquery**.

It features:

- A modern T3 stack web app — built with **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **tRPC**, and **Tailwind**, packaged in Docker  
- A native **Swift app for macOS**  
- A native **C# app for Windows**  
- Multi-cloud infrastructure support (Azure and AWS) for ingestion and processing  
- Built-in compatibility with our favorite software deployment primates: **Munki** and **Cimian**

Designed for real-time telemetry across macOS and Windows fleets, Reportmate provides visibility, modularity, and modern deployment workflows — all open to community extension through standalone module repositories.
